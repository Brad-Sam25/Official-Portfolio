## My Backstory 

Prior to my career change into the tech sphere (web and software development), I worked in law firm as a legal assistant with aspirations of eventually becoming a real estate or patent attorney. Our particular firm used a closing software named Qualia and after close contact and numerous requests for new features with their team, I found myself gravitating more towards the technological side of our process.

Subsequently, I came to a relaization that I was in the wrong occupational field and made the decision to pursue my true aspiration which is front-end and back-end development!

While leveraging my legal research methods, I have been able to learn new technologies and implement them in a timely and efficient manner for more intuitve user experiences.
